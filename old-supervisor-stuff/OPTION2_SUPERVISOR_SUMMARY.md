# Option 2: Multi-Process Container with Supervisor - Implementation Summary

## What We Built

Successfully implemented **Option 2** - a single Docker container running multiple processes managed by Supervisor. This approach packages all our microservices (Rails app + 3 background services) into one deployable container while maintaining their conceptual separation.

## Architecture

```
Single Docker Container
├── Supervisor (Process Manager)
├── Rails App (Process 1) - Port 3000
├── Email Service (Process 2) - SQS Consumer  
├── Inventory Service (Process 3) - SQS Consumer
└── Analytics Service (Process 4) - SQS Consumer
```

## Files Created

### 1. `supervisord.conf`
- **Purpose**: Configuration for Supervisor process manager
- **Manages**: 4 processes (rails_app, email_service, inventory_service, analytics_service)
- **Features**: Auto-restart, logging, process monitoring

### 2. `Dockerfile.supervisor`  
- **Base Image**: `ruby:3.4.2-slim` (matches Rails app requirements)
- **Dependencies**: supervisor, build-essential, libsqlite3-dev, libyaml-dev
- **Process**: Installs Rails deps, AWS SDK gems, creates production DB
- **Entry Point**: Supervisor daemon

## Key Implementation Details

### Process Management
- **Supervisor**: Controls all 4 processes from single configuration
- **Auto-restart**: Failed processes automatically restart
- **Logging**: Separate log files for each service
- **Status monitoring**: `supervisorctl status` shows all process states

### Container Structure
```bash
/app/
├── order_publisher/          # Rails app
├── services/                 # Microservices
│   ├── email-service/
│   ├── inventory-service/
│   └── analytics-service/
└── /var/log/                # Service logs
    ├── rails.{out,err}.log
    ├── email.{out,err}.log
    ├── inventory.{out,err}.log
    └── analytics.{out,err}.log
```

### AWS Integration
- **Environment Variables**: AWS credentials and region passed to container
- **SQS Access**: All services can connect to AWS SQS queues
- **Long Polling**: Services wait for messages (20-second polls)

## Build & Run Commands

### Build Container
```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile.supervisor -t pubsub-supervisor .
```

### Run Container  
```bash
docker run -d --name pubsub-test -p 3001:3000 \
  -e AWS_REGION=us-east-1 \
  -e AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=484123688626 \
  -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_key \
  -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret \
  pubsub-supervisor
```

### Monitor Services
```bash
# Check all process status
docker exec pubsub-test supervisorctl status

# View service logs
docker exec pubsub-test supervisorctl tail email_service

# Check container logs
docker logs pubsub-test
```

## Verification Results

✅ **Container Build**: Successfully built with all dependencies  
✅ **Process Startup**: All 4 processes start and remain running  
✅ **Rails App**: Accessible on http://localhost:3001  
✅ **SQS Connection**: Services connect to AWS SQS (with credentials)  
✅ **Process Management**: Supervisor properly manages all processes  

## Advantages of This Approach

### ✅ Pros
- **Simple Deployment**: Single container to deploy
- **Resource Efficiency**: Shared container resources
- **Easy Local Development**: `docker run` starts everything
- **Process Monitoring**: Supervisor handles restarts/failures
- **Preserved Architecture**: Services remain conceptually separate
- **Fast Development**: Quick iteration and testing

### ❌ Cons  
- **Tight Coupling**: Container failure affects all services
- **No Independent Scaling**: Can't scale individual services
- **Shared Resources**: One heavy process affects others
- **Debugging Complexity**: Multiple logs in one container

## Next Steps Options

1. **Deploy to AWS ECS**: Use this container in Fargate
2. **Add Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code for deployment
3. **Migrate to Option 3**: Multi-stage build for more flexibility
4. **Add Monitoring**: Health checks and metrics collection

## Production Considerations

- **Security**: Use IAM roles instead of hardcoded credentials
- **Logging**: Centralized log aggregation (CloudWatch, ELK)
- **Health Checks**: Container health endpoint
- **Resource Limits**: Set CPU/memory constraints
- **Secret Management**: Use AWS Secrets Manager

## Terraform Integration Ready

This container is ready for Terraform deployment:
- Single ECR repository needed
- Simple ECS task definition
- Can be deployed to Fargate or EC2
- Easy to scale horizontally (entire stack scales together)

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED & WORKING**  
**Next**: Ready for Terraform deployment or migration to Option 3
